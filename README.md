## About me

- Career changer from 20 years in the aviation industry to the Software Testing world. In my previous roles I was a skilled and hardworking aviation mechanic, but due to the ongoing pandemic my previous employer was forced to lay off all employees. While this period was unplanned and unexpected, I put the time to good use by choosing to follow a new career path and further expand my education.
Although my experience as a software tester is limited, I have shown dedication in this new career by completing numerous online courses and achieving my Certified Tester certificate from the International Software Testing Qualifications Board.
